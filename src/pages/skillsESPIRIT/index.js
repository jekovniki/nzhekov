                Working in Modo Ltd. and then in Eurostar-BG Ltd. I was able to learn and use lots of 
                Content Management Systems(CMS). Using Adobe Experience Manager, SDL Tridion, Typo 3, 
                First spirit (e-spirit) was part of my daily responsibilities. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With these CMS, apart from managing the content, I was also building landing pages which
                allowed me to use these systems in-depth and understand them. I was able to work on websites
                for big and well-known international websites which is an experience that I value.
